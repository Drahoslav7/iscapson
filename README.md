# IsCapsOn?

Windows tray icon app indicating whether the Caps Lock is switched on or off.


Now also attempts to automatically switch capslock when intended. This only makes sense with my [en/cs keyboard layout](https://gist.github.com/Drahoslav7/7407d8d95e61f65f3fb4) or similar, where Caps Lock is used for switching between numbers and characters with diacritics.
